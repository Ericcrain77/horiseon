# Horiseon

In this activity, I refactored the code someone else had written for the client, Horiseon.

In the html code, there were several unnecessary classes assigned to elements that were removed, as well as some organization that needed to be corrected. 
In the css code, several elements needed consolidation in order to remove duplicate lines of code. There were also a few bugs that needed to be corrected in order for the landing page to load correctly.

The following image is a screenshot of the finished, corrected html code.
